Python-Text-Adventure
=====================

This is a text adventure game written entirely in Python. The main goal in creating the application is to learn and experiment with ways of solving problems. Because of this, it is by no means a 'perfect solution' to writing a text adventure game in Python.

The application will begin as a very simple structure for a text adventure game, and slowly become a much more complex game as gameplay elements and mechanics are added.

If you'd like to contribute at this stage of development, helping by refactoring code and leaving a helpful commit description explaining why the edited code is superior is very much appreciated.

Master branch is for working releases, dev branch is for development of the next release.
